## Setting up a React Environment

If you have **NPM** and **Node.js** installed, you can create a React application by first installing the create-react-app.

Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:
  `npm install -g create-react-app`
  
Then you are able to create a React application, create one called **first**.

Run this command to create a React application named **first**:
  `npx create-react-app first`
  
The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.


## Installation and including dependencies

Run this command to move to the first directory:
  `cd first`

Install the react-fusioncharts and fusioncharts modules using the following command:
  `npm install fusioncharts react-fusioncharts --save`
  
  
## Replacing files

Replace the **'src'** folder and the **'package.json'** file either directly downloading from repository or downloading the replace.rar file from repository and then extract and replace.
  
  
## Run the React Application

Run this command to move to the first directory:
  `cd first`

Run this command to run the React application first:
  `npm start`
  
A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
